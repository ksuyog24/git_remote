I have had a rigorous learning curve in the field of computing during my formative years and
this has helped me strengthen my technical knowledge as well as boost my confidence. I began with C++,
and that gave me a basic understanding of the programming structures, such as variables, looping structures, 
conditioning structures, and algorithmic structures, so that the foundation of my further investigation was relatively strong.
After this, I shifted into the world of HTML and CSS, which allowed me to design and develop (artistically) web interfaces that allowed
the creation of information and content that tends to be more interactive and appealing to the eye in particular. Parallel to that, I learned 
Python and this experience enhanced my concept of the scripting paradigm, automation structures, and code writing principles in a range of applications.
Simultaneously, I studied command-line interaction in a Linux system and learned how to utilize the terminal, handle files, and have an intellectual 
understanding of the operating system basics. The choice of Visual Studio Code as an integrated development environment was mostly used during this
development process, which is commonly available to support heterogeneous language, capabilities to extend and debug, facilitating cross-technological
workflow within a single platform. In the end, this experience has become cumulative and enhanced my logical thinking, heightened my ability to solve problems, 
and increased my academic curiosity toward the field of software development.
