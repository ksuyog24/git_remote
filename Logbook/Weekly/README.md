# Introduction to Programming – Weekly Logbook Portfolio

This repository contains the completed **Weekly Logbooks** for the *Introduction to Programming* module. These documents serve as a portfolio of my progress, covering theoretical concepts, code snippets, and practical problem-solving exercises from Week 1 through Week 8.

## Portfolio Contents

The following logbooks are included in this submission. Each file contains answers to lecture questions and code solutions.

### **Week 1: Introduction & Environment**
* **File:** `Exercises_01.docx`
* **Key Concepts Covered:**
  * The **CPython** interpreter and the **REPL** (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop) model.
  * Distinguishing between **Machine Code** (1st Gen), **Assembly** (2nd Gen), and **High-Level Languages** (3rd Gen).
  * Identifying **Syntax Errors** vs. **Logical Errors**.
  * Basic arithmetic expressions using Python operators (`*`, `/`, `**`).

### **Week 2: Variables & Types**
* **File:** `Exercises 02.docx`
* **Key Concepts Covered:**
  * Core data types: `int`, `float`, `bool`, and `str`.
  * **Mutability vs. Immutability** (e.g., Strings are immutable).
  * Using the `type()` function to inspect data.
  * Input handling with `input()` and augmented assignment operators (e.g., `total += 10`).

### **Week 4: Functions**
*(Note: Week 3 is not included in this upload)*
* **File:** `focp week4 exercise.docx`
* **Key Concepts Covered:**
  * Defining functions with `def` and using Docstrings for documentation.
  * Importing modules (e.g., `import math`, `from math import sqrt`).
  * Understanding **Parameters** and **Return** values.
  * Advanced function features: **Lambda expressions** and variable arguments (`*args`).

### **Week 5: Scripts & Modules**
* **File:** `week 5 exercise.docx`
* **Key Concepts Covered:**
  * Writing and executing Python scripts (`.py`) via the **Command Line**.
  * Handling **Command Line Arguments** using `sys.argv`.
  * Understanding the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
  * Distinguishing between running a script directly versus importing it as a module.

### **Week 6: Lists & Tuples**
* **File:** `week 6 Exercise.docx`
* **Key Concepts Covered:**
  * **Method Calls** vs. **Function Calls**.
  * Manipulating lists: `.append()`, `.extend()`, `.pop()`, `.reverse()`.
  * Using **Tuples** (immutable sequences) and **Unpacking** values.
  * Iterating over sequences with `for` loops.

### **Week 7: Sets & Dictionaries**
* **File:** `Exercise 7.docx`
* **Key Concepts Covered:**
  * **Sets:** Unordered collections, `set()` constructor, and set operations (Union `|`, Intersection `&`).
  * **Dictionaries:** Key-Value mappings and iterating over `.keys()` vs `.values()`.
  * Understanding `frozenset` (immutable sets).
  * Set comprehensions.

### **Week 8: I/O and File Handling**
* **File:** `Exercises 8.docx`
* **Key Concepts Covered:**
  * **File I/O:** Opening files safely with the `with` statement.
  * Reading/Writing methods: `.read()`, `.readlines()`, `.write()`.
  * **String Formatting:** Using Python **f-strings** (e.g., `f"Value: {x:.2f}"`) for precise output control.
  * File pointer manipulation using `.seek()` and `.tell()`.
